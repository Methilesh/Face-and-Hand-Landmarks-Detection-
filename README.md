**Face and Hand Landmarks Detection with OpenCV and MediaPipe**

# Face and Hand Landmarks Detection with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This repository provides an implementation of face and hand landmarks detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. The code demonstrates how to detect and visualize facial landmarks (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) and hand landmarks (e.g., fingertips, joints) in real-time using a webcam feed.

## Requirements
- Python (>= 3.6)
- OpenCV (>= 4.5.3)
- MediaPipe (>= 0.8.7.1)

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/face-hand-landmarks.git
cd face-hand-landmarks
```

2. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will open a window displaying the webcam feed with face and hand landmarks overlaid in real-time.
