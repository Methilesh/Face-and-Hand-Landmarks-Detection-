## Features

- Real-time detection of facial landmarks including eyes, nose, mouth, and contours.
- Detection of hand landmarks and connections for both left and right hands.
- Display of frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/face-and-hand-landmarks-detection.git
cd face-and-hand-landmarks-detection
```

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python landmarks_detection.py
```

3. To exit the program, press the `Esc` key.
